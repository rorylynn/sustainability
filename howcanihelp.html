        <h3>Sustainable Brands</h3><br>
          <h4>Sustainable brands are quickly growing due to the emphasis on climate change within current American society</h4> 
          <h4>While they can be flawed and still do damage to the environment, they are far better for the environment and for workers</h4>
          <h4>These brands tend to be expensive; Reformation or Lisa Says Gah dresses can sell for $200 a piece. Everlane, while still expensive, has more do-able prices. This is a great option for those who can afford it.</h4>
          
        <h3>Resell Sites</h3>
          <h4>These sites are cheaper and more realistic for most people.</h4>
          <h4>Apps like Depop or Poshmark are a good place to find used clothing that has already been made rather than producing new items.</h4>
          
        <h3>Thrift and Vintage Stores</h3>
          <h4>Thrift stores are a great place to shop sustainably and ethically without costing too much money.</h4>
          <h4>Goodwill outlets are where clothes that are not sold at regular thrift stores end up. Items are sold by weight and are significantly cheaper.</h4> 
          <h4>These can also be a great option to get clothes before they are incinerated or put in landfills. Bring clothes and an enthusiasm to Goodwill Outlets.</h4>
          <h4>Thrift stores are often hard to navigate so here are some general tips:</h4>
              <h5>Look in all sections and all sizes. Sizes vary based on brand and time they were made so a vary of sizes can fit.</h5>
              <h5>Try all items on</h5>
              <h5>Shop in both the mens and womens sections</h5>
              <h5>Committ to spending a while shopping, so you can look through everything. Great pieces are often hiding</h5>
          <h4>For plus size people it can be hard to find clothes at regular thrift stores. Thread Up is an online thrift store that tends to have more size options.</h4>
          <h4>Vintage stores are typically more expensive, but are a great option for occasional buying.</h4>
        <h3>Small Businesses</h3>
           <h4>Many small businesses aren't as sustainable for the earth as other options, but have better ethical practices towards workers</h4>
           <h4>Fast fashion brands consistently exploit their workers, so the treatment of workers is important in a discussion on sustainable fashion.</h4>
   
        <h3>Before buying from a company, do your research. Often brands that appear sustainable are not as sustainable in practice. Become familiar with their policy and look for details on how they are sustainable.</h3>
           <h3>As a reminder, individuals do not hold most of the blame for the fashion industry's impact on the environment. That falls mostly on fast fashion companies.</h3>
        <h3>Try not to be hard on yourself if you can't shop fully sustainably. Shopping and living sustainably is not easy and is not always attainable.</h3>
